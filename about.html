I am a security researcher, based in Singapore. I like to experiment with computer programs trying to circumvent security. Also, I enjoy troubleshooting computer systems, and playing computer games. Apart from these, I like to read about world political-military affairs and foreign policies of nations.

This is my place on the web since my previous domain name expired, and I’m trying to keep things simple since then. In case you find something interesting on this blog, drop me a message, and if you are lucky I’ll get back to you. :-)

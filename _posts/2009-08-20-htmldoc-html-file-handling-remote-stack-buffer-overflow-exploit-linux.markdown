The vulnerability exists in HTMLDOC version 1.8.27 and earlier due to an unsafe call to `sscanf()` in the `set_page_size()` function in `htmldoc/util.cxx`. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when an HTML document containing e.g. a specially crafted "MEDIA SIZE" comment is being processed.

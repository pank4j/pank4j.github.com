httpdx is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the `h_handlepeer()` function. By sending an overly long HTTP GET request, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.

This exploit is also available as a metasploit moduleÂ [here](http://www.metasploit.com/modules/exploit/windows/http/httpdx_handlepeer). Thanks to Trancer for porting it to Metasploit.
